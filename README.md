# Social Network API

## Description

The **Social Network API** is a backend application for a social media platform that allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and maintain a list of friends. This API is built using **Express.js** for routing, **MongoDB** as the database, and **Mongoose** for schema management.

The API supports a variety of features, including user management, thought creation, reactions, and the ability to create and remove friends. The database is structured using NoSQL principles, allowing for the handling of large and unstructured datasets, making it perfect for a social networking platform.
